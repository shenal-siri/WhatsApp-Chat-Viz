[2020-02-28, 2:56:27 AM] User 1: 😯 Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock ☺

[2020-02-29, 5:58:52 PM] User 1: How long they seemed, those quarters! 😯

[2020-03-01, 3:02:42 AM] User 1: Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator ☹️
[2020-03-01, 3:14:28 AM] User 2: , which vanished immediately 😄
[2020-03-01, 3:35:29 AM] User 2: but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.
[2020-03-01, 3:45:42 AM] User 2: Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. 😭
[2020-03-01, 3:56:44 AM] User 2: 😭
[2020-03-01, 4:09:48 AM] User 1: I heard a gentle sound of movement, 😆
[2020-03-01, 4:09:56 AM] User 1: and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger.  👀
[2020-03-01, 5:10:08 AM] User 1: For half an hour I sat with straining ears. 😯
[2020-03-02, 10:10:29 PM] User 1: Then suddenly another sound became audible 😯
[2020-03-02, 10:15:24 PM] User 1: 😯
[2020-03-02, 10:20:32 PM] User 2: --a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle
[2020-03-07, 12:45:42 AM] User 2: The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed 😭
[2020-03-07, 12:56:44 AM] User 2: 😭
[2020-03-07, 12:09:48 AM] User 1: struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull. 😆
[2020-03-07, 12:09:56 AM] User 1: 😯👀
[2020-03-08, 05:10:08 PM] User 1: "You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"

[2020-03-08, 05:20:32 PM] User 2: At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle
[2020-03-08, 05:45:56 PM] User 1: but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes
made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely.
[2020-03-08, 05:50:34 PM] User 2: I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing 😭😭😭
